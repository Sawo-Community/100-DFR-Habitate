## Contributing

### Getting Started

To get started with the contribution in the Habitate repository, simply fork it into your local GitHub account. Make the changes in the forked repository. In this case, the change will be related to the feature that you will be putting in. You can also clone the repository first, and then fork and push it along with the changes. This will also raise a PR. 

**Note**: <b>Please be aware that Habitate will not share any codebase for this challenge. You are free to develop your own solution using your creativity and imagination (Like that in a hackathon). But, you have to keep the problem statament in mind while developing a solution.</b>

### Submission Guide

To make a submission for the brand Habitate in 100 Days of Feature Request, as a first step, fork the repository by clicking the fork button at the right hand corner. In the forked repository, you will be able to make changes and upload your code regarding the feature that you will be making and contributing. 

In the forked repository, create a folder and in that folder, add all the required codes and documents needed for the feature. The folder name should contain your name and the name of the feature which you have built. After naming the folder and later on adding and uploading the contents inside the folder, you will be ready to raise a pull request.

**In the folder, you must have to make a README.md file which will have a detailed description about the feature solution.** 

When you are raising a Pull Request, keep in mind to give a proper title of the PR which will be relevant to the changes. In the description section, give a proper description that will tell the summary of the feature request that you have built. Also, you can use markdown in the description that will help you to embed any link or add anything relevant with the description.

### Creating Pull Requests

1. When you're ready to submit your changes, add a descriptive title and comments to summarize the changes made.
2. Select **Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request**.
3. Check the **Propose file change** button.
4. Scroll down to compare changes with the original document.
5. Select **Create pull request**. 

### Commenting on Pull Requests

Once a pull request is submitted, multiple committers may comment on it and provide edits or suggestions which you can commit directly. You can also add line comments. Take a look at [Commenting on pull requests](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request) for more details.

### Labelling Pull Requests

A raised Pull Request will be labelled according to the work that has been done in the Pull Request. There are several labels to determine the work that is on-going with the Pull Request. For example, we requested a change in the pull request from the submitter, then the PR will be labelled as *awaiting submitter action*. 

### Reviewing Pull Requests

The Pull Requests will be reviewed on a first come first serve basis. The community and product team of SAWO Labs will be responsible for the reviewing of Pull Requests. Keep in mind that spams will not be tolerated. 

While reviewing the Pull Requests, we may contact the submitter of the PR regarding any changes that need to be made. If the submitter doesn't respond even after making several calls, then we will be forced to close the PR by labelling it as *incomplete*.

Once the review process is complete, the change is either merged into master and pushed immediately or merged into the release branch and pushed in alignment with the release. The branch is then deleted.

## Building and Validating

If you've downloaded the repository and are making a feature on your local machine, you can generate the HTML files from markdown. You can review your changes before you commit them or create pull requests.

**Note:** Commands can be executed on Linux, Mac, and Windows (using Powershell).

1. Open a terminal window, then clone a forked copy of the Habitate repository by running the following command::
