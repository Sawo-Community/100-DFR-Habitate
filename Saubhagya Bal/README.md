### Understanding The Product

1. first I create an account in [Habitate.io](http://Habitate.io) to check their UI and what they have as their product features.
2. So, after using all the features that habitate have provided for community builders, I conclude that they have a board for specific channels like in slack, but its more about posts.

### Problems Conclusion

1. Great simple easy to use platform for community builders.
2. but don't have specific features for specific community 
    1. **Audio Room** (for music community)
    2. **Social Feed** (for engagement & sharing things)
    3. **Virtual Hangout Room** (for concert or any event to conduct (e.g book show, storytelling)

### Research :

1. So, to make the platform more engaging we have to give more features to the users to allow them to communicate using audio, video or a shared virtual event.
2. You can see some of the features and their use cases for habitate.io community builders below in my scratch note page.
